# demo-backend

A simple backend project built with **Python** and **FastAPI**.  
The main goal of this project is **learning and practicing** backend development and deployment workflows.

## 🛠️ What This Project Is About

This project was created to practice:

- Building APIs using **FastAPI**
- Setting up an asynchronous stack with:
  - **asyncpg** (PostgreSQL driver)
  - **SQLAlchemy** (Core/ORM)
  - **Alembic** (Database migrations)
- Writing unit tests with **pytest**
- Enforcing code quality with:
  - **Pre-commit** hooks
  - **Ruff** (Linter/Formatter)
  - **mypy** (Static type checking)
- Dockerizing the backend with a **Dockerfile**
- Managing services using **Docker Compose**
- Using **NGINX** as a reverse proxy
- Implementing **CI/CD** pipelines via **GitHub Actions** and **Watchtower**
- Deploying to an **Ubuntu server**

> **Note:** This backend project is built mainly for **infrastructure and deployment learning purposes**, not for production usage.
